					<p class="factsubheader">Call Ahead. If you have plans to go to a restaurant but aren’t sure if there will be vegan options, just give them a call and ask. If the restaurant really doesn’t have vegan options, you can change your plans. Calling ahead also let’s the chef know ahead of time that you are coming so if they want to prepare something special ahead of time they have the time to do so. This allows you to relax when you get to the restaurant because you already know the options. You can also try looking the menu up online.  </p>
					<p class="factsubheader">Be Clear. When first switching to a plant-based, it can be uncomfortable to use the word “vegan,” especially if you worry about causing inconvenience. In fact, people often would prefer clarity so that they can address your situation correctly and without confusion.</p>
					<p class="factsubheader">Be Nice. When you ask, just be polite! You don’t have to shout at the world.  Avoid making a million demands or trying to deconstruct the ingredient list. Just ask if there are vegan friendly options with a smile on your face. Not everyone knows what a vegan diet is, and if you encounter this, help them out by explaining what you don’t eat. If you are nice, people will be nice right back.</p>
					<p class="factsubheader">Look for the Codes. Menus often have little icons next to items that indicate which items are vegan or vegetarian, just like they do if an item is spicy. Sometimes it is a little “v” or a leaf. Looking for a guide can help you better understand the menu.</p>
					<p class="factsubheader">Get Clever. Most menus have vegetarian options which can easily be made vegan. Just ask if the dairy or egg can be removed from the dish to make it vegan friendly. </p>
					<p class="factsubheader">Sometimes when you remove an ingredient the dish might need something else to boost it up a notch, if this is the case, peruse around the menu until you see another ingredient that you think would be great, and ask for a substitution. (A good example of this is ordering a veggie burrito. Ask for the cheese and sour cream to be removed, and instead replace it with guacamole.) Saying the word sub or replace is key because then they are likely to not charge you extra! </p>
					<p class="factsubheader">If there are no main dishes that are easily made vegan, look to the sides. Often there are lots of side dishes that are vegan friendly, or can be adapted, so order a big plate of those and enjoy being able to try many different dishes while your table mates are left to choose a single menu item.</p>

					<p class="fact">Eat more whole foods</p>
					<p class="factsubheader">Eating more whole foods will not only help you cut out some of the more processed foods from your diet by increasing your intake of nutrients from fresh foods, but it will also save you money. Many processed vegan foods are more expensive than their omnivore counterparts, which is why omnivores tend to believe that vegan is synonymous with an expensive diet.</p>
					<p class="factsubheader">Processed foods can be helpful in the beginning of your plant-based journey by making the transition more fluid, but a vegan diet is absolutely not dependent on them, and as time goes by, many vegans find that they prefer to base their diet around whole foods instead.</p>

But diets high in animal protein, cholesterol (which is nearly impossible to consume with a vegan diet) and saturated fat play a key role in the leading causes of death in America.</p>
